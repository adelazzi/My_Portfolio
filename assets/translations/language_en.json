My journey includes a 1-year internship with software companies, where I gained solid industry experience and sharpened my technical and teamwork skills.\n\nIn addition to development, I actively mentor students on their final-year (PFE) projects using Flutter, providing technical guidance and best practices. As a full-stack developer, I combine Flutter for frontend with Django for backend to deliver complete, scalable applications.\n\nCurrently pursuing a Master's in High-Performance Computing (HPC), focusing on big data and parallel computing—aiming to blend intelligent data processing with real-world application development.",
